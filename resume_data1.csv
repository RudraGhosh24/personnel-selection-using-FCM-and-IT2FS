IMAGE RETRIEVAL 
 
TEAM MEMBERS: FOUR NUMBERS 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
 
An effective content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system depends on the discriminative feature which 
represents an image. In this work, we explore deep convolutional features for a CBIR system. We first 
show the effectiveness of deep convolutional channel features for a CBIR system. Then we introduce 
a Multi-Level Pooling method (MLP) to obtain object-aware features from convolutional layers and finally 
the features extracted from different layers are incorporated to a short representation vector. Through 
multiple experiments, we show that our approach can achieve state-of-art results on several benchmark 
retrieval datasets."

Project Description: 
Our Project takes over the task of Ringing of the Bell in Colleges. It replaces the Manual Switching of the Bell in the 
College. It has an Inbuilt Real Time Clock which tracks over the Real Time. When this time equals to the Bell Ringing 
time, then the Relay for the Bell is switched on. The Bell Ringing time can be edited at any Time, so that it can be used 
at Normal Class Timings as well as Exam Times. The Real Time Clock is displayed on LCD display. LPC2148 is used to 
control all the Functions, it get the time through the keypad and store it in its Memory."

IMAGE RETRIEVAL 
 
TEAM MEMBERS: FOUR NUMBERS 
 
DESCRIPTION: 
 
An effective content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system depends on the discriminative feature which 
represents an image. In this work, we explore deep convolutional features for a CBIR system. We first 
show the effectiveness of deep convolutional channel features for a CBIR system. Then we introduce 
a Multi-Level Pooling method (MLP) to obtain object-aware features from convolutional layers and finally 
the features extracted from different layers are incorporated to a short representation vector. Through 
multiple experiments, we show that our approach can achieve state-of-art results on several benchmark 
retrieval datasets."

Project Title: MULTIGRID RELIBLE ROUTING FOR WIRELESS 
SENSOR NETWORKS 
 
Description: In a wireless sensor networks the concentration of data traffic towards the sink causes the nearby nodes to loss their batteries quicker than other nodes, which leaves the sink stranded and disrupts the sensor data reporting. To mitigate this problem the usage of mobile sinks is proposed. Mobile sinks implicitly provide load-balancing and help achieving uniform energy-consumption across the network. However, the mechanisms to support the sink mobility (e.g., adv ertising the location of the mobile sink to the network) introduce an overhead in terms of energy consumption and packet delays. With these properties mobile sink routing constitutes an interesting research field with unique requirements. In this paper, we present a survey of the existing distributed mobile sink routing protocols. In order to provide an insight to the rationale and the concerns of a mobile sink routing protocol, design requirements and challenges associated with the problem of mobile sink routing are determined and explained. A definitive and detailed categorization is made and the protocols' advantages and drawbacks are determined with respect to their target applications.

Moreover, different websites often provide conflicting information on a subject, such as different specifications for the same product. In this paper, we propose a new problem, called Veracity, i.e., conformity to truth, which studies how to find true facts from a large amount of conflicting information on many subjects that, is provided by various websites. We design a general framework for the Veracity problem and invent an algorithm, called TRUTHFINDER, which utilizes the \nRelationships between websites and their information, i.e., a website are trustworthy if it provides many pieces of true information, and a piece of information is likely to be true if it is provided by many trustworthy websites. An iterative method is used to infer the trustworthiness of websites and the correctness of information from each other. Our experiments show that TRUTHFINDER successfully finds true facts among conflicting information and identifies trustworthy websites better than the popular search engines.'}]}","{0: [{'e_title:': 'M.Tech in Software Engineering'}, {'e_schoolname:': 'JNTU'}, {'e_city:': 'Kakinada'}, {'e_state:': ' Andhra Pradesh'}, {'e_duration:': '2009 to 2011'}], 1: [{'e_title:': 'B.Tech in Information Technology'}, {'e_schoolname:': 'JNTU'}, {'e_city:': 'Hyderabad'}, {'e_state:': ' Andhra Pradesh'}, {'e_duration:': '2004 to 2008'}], 2: [{'e_title:': 'Certificate'}, {'e_schoolname:': 'Siddartha High School'}, {'e_city:': 'Eluru'}, {'e_state:': ' Andhra Pradesh'}, {'e_duration:': '2001 to 2002'}]}",['NONE'],[],{},NONE

TITLE: IMPLENTATION OF FAKE CURRENCY NOTE RECOGNIGATION 
USING MATLAB. 
• In recent years, the reserve bank changes the design of bank notes from time to time, reserve bank uses several techniques to detect fake currency. Common people face many problems by fake currency circulation and it is difficult to detect fake currency. 
• Suppose a common man went to a bank to deposit money but only to see that some of the notes are fake, in this case he has to take the blame, as banks will not help that person. 
• Proposed system is to help common man to recognize currency for originality is based on image processing and makes the process automatic and robust. 
• Shape information are used in proposed system to extract the various features of currency notes using MATLAB software. 
• The proposed system has advantages like simplicity and high-performance speed, the results will predict whether the currency note is fake or not."
